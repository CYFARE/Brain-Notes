## Basic Coverage Modes

### CLASSIC
**Description:** The default instrumentation mode that provides traditional edge coverage by tracking transitions between basic blocks.

**Best for:** General-purpose fuzzing and initial exploration of targets. Offers good balance between performance and coverage insights.

### COVERAGE_ONLY
**Description:** Lightweight instrumentation focused purely on edge coverage without additional tracking features.

**Best for:** Performance-critical fuzzing campaigns where speed is essential but basic coverage tracking is still needed.

## Enhanced Coverage Modes

### CTX
**Description:** Adds context-sensitive edge coverage by tracking not just the current transition but also the history of prior edges.

**Best for:** Complex applications with state-dependent behavior where understanding execution history improves bug discovery.

### NGRAM-k
**Description:** Tracks sequences of k consecutive edges (where k=2, 3, etc.), enabling higher-order Markov modeling for coverage.

**Best for:** Applications with context-sensitive logic where simple edge coverage misses important behavioral patterns. Higher values of k provide more context at the cost of performance.

### PCGUARD
**Description:** Adds fine-grained instrumentation at every control flow decision (branches, calls, returns) in the program.

**Best for:** Thorough testing where maximizing coverage quality is more important than raw execution speed.

### TRACE-PC
**Description:** Records the program counter (PC) for each basic block executed during program runs.

**Best for:** Debugging, generating detailed execution traces, or analyzing code flow in complex applications.

## Advanced Analysis Modes

### TRACE-CMP
**Description:** Focuses on tracking and logging comparison operations (e.g., `cmp`, `strcmp`) during execution.

**Best for:** Fuzzing inputs that rely on matching specific patterns, magic values, or string comparisons.

### REDQUEEN
**Description:** Implements sophisticated value tracking and mutation techniques to guide fuzzing based on observed constraints.

**Best for:** Breaking through complex input validation checks and exploring heavily constrained input spaces.

### LTO
**Description:** Uses Link-Time Optimization for instrumentation, enabling whole-program analysis and more precise coverage.

**Best for:** Large, complex programs where cross-module optimizations and precise instrumentation improve fuzzing effectiveness.

## Special Purpose Modes

### NONE
**Description:** Completely disables instrumentation while still using the AFL++ framework.

**Best for:** Testing configurations, running control experiments, or creating non-instrumented builds for specific purposes.

### QASAN
**Description:** Combines AFL++ instrumentation with AddressSanitizer (ASAN) capabilities to detect memory corruption issues.

**Best for:** Finding memory-related vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and other memory safety bugs.

### AUTO_DICT
**Description:** Automatically extracts and instruments dictionary-like inputs (strings, constants) from the target code.

**Best for:** Fuzzing targets that process structured data like parsers for JSON, XML, or custom file formats.

### INST_RATIO
**Description:** Controls the percentage of basic blocks that receive instrumentation, allowing for coverage/performance tuning.

**Best for:** Very large binaries where full instrumentation would create excessive overhead, allowing strategic coverage.

## Usage Tips

- Combine modes when possible (e.g., LTO with NGRAM or REDQUEEN with TRACE-CMP)
- Start with CLASSIC for initial exploration, then switch to specialized modes
- For memory corruption bugs, QASAN provides the most comprehensive detection
- When dealing with complex input formats, pair AUTO_DICT with appropriate coverage modes
